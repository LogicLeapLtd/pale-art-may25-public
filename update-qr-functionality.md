# QR Code Functionality Update Instructions

## Changes Made

✅ **Database Schema Updated**: Added `qrCodeUrl` field to Product model
✅ **API Route Created**: `/api/artworks/[id]/generate-qr` for saving QR codes
✅ **Admin Dashboard Updated**: Conditional buttons based on QR code existence
✅ **Activity Logging**: QR code generation is now tracked

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Update Database Schema
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### 2. Test Locally
1. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to Admin → QR Codes
3. Click "Generate QR Code" on any artwork
4. Verify the button changes to "Show QR Code" (green)
5. Click "Show QR Code" to view the saved QR code

### 3. Deploy to Production
1. Commit and push your changes
2. Redeploy on Vercel
3. The database schema will update automatically

## How It Works Now

### Before (Old Behavior):
- ❌ QR codes were generated on-demand only
- ❌ No persistence - had to regenerate every time
- ❌ No tracking of which artworks had QR codes

### After (New Behavior):
- ✅ QR codes are generated and **saved to database**
- ✅ Button shows "Generate QR Code" for new artworks
- ✅ Button shows "Show QR Code" (green) for artworks with existing QR codes
- ✅ QR code generation is logged in Activity feed
- ✅ QR code status indicator (gold "QR ✓" badge) in QR codes grid

## Features Added

1. **Persistent QR Codes**: Once generated, QR codes are saved and can be shown again
2. **Smart Buttons**: UI adapts based on QR code existence
3. **Visual Indicators**: Gold "QR ✓" badge shows which artworks have QR codes
4. **Activity Tracking**: All QR code generation is logged
5. **Better UX**: Clear distinction between generate vs show actions

## Database Changes

New field added to `Product` table:
```sql
qrCodeUrl String?
```

This stores the full QR code image URL from api.qrserver.com for each artwork.
