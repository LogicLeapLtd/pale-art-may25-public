ARTIST: Alla Chakir
SPECIALITY: Painting & Mixed Media


BIO:
Alla Chakir was born in 1955 in the village of Kotlovyna in the Odesa region of Ukraine. Growing up on the banks of a beautiful river, she was profoundly influenced by a childhood memory of watching the scarlet disk of the sun at dawn - a moment that remains etched in her memory and influences her work wherever she travels.

From an early age, Alla showed artistic talent, sculpting animals from the multi-colored clay found along the rivershore - blue, yellow, and red. These formative experiences, combined with encouragement from her father who was also an artist, meant there was never any question about her future path.

Alla studied at the Odessa Grekov Art School from 1972 to 1977, mastering ceramics, pastels, and painting. She views painting as an enigma with infinite possibilities, describing it as both "rest and labor of my soul." As a student in 1973, she began actively participating in group exhibitions throughout Ukraine.

Her career milestones include her first solo exhibition in 1997 and membership in the National Union of Artists of Ukraine since 2000. She has participated in numerous exhibitions in Ukraine and abroad, including international art festivals in Canada, France, and the USA.

Currently residing in North Wales, Alla continues to create paintings and mixed media works, and is available for commissions. She is the mother of artist Roman Nedopaka and collaborates with him on various artworks.
