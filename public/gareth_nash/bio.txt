FULL ARTIST BIO:

From a young age, I have been captivated by the transformative power of clay. My grandmother would buy me brightly coloured plasticine and I spent countless hours modelling horses channelling my emotions into tactile, physical forms. Horses were the first creatures I encountered outside of my family home. Early connection to both horses and clay has profoundly shaped my artistic journey, enabling me to express my inner world with depth. Clay can be used to make functional objects but its ability to shape feelings and emotions through its plasticity is what truly inspires me sparking a lifelong passion for expressing myself in clay.

EDUCATION:
- First-class degree from the University of Wales, Cardiff
- Scholarship to the Royal College of Art

PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES:
- Leads clay and glaze workshops focused on the history of the horse in ceramics
- Teaches SEND learners pottery at Richmond and Hillcroft Adult Community College in West London
- Currently researching to write a book on ceramic horses in history

RESIDENCIES:
- 2017: Residency in Fuping, China, exploring ceramic traditions of the Wei and Tang dynasties
- Studied how Tang Dynasty artisans captured equine anatomy in clay with remarkable precision

ARTISTIC FOCUS:
My work frequently incorporates animals, particularly horses, as symbols to convey emotions and personal narratives. Clay, with its inherent plasticity, allows me to shape these feelings into tangible forms, creating a dialogue between the inner self and the external world. I explore themes of Gender Dysphoria within my ceramic practice, reflecting narratives from the LGBTQ+ community. Through this work, I aim to use clay as a powerful medium for engaging audiences with profound emotions and compelling imagery to break through stigma and fear.

RESEARCH AREAS:
- Study of the horse in ceramic history focusing on India and Japan
- Bankura and Haniwa clay horses
- Historical ceramic techniques bridging past and contemporary artistry

Clay continues to excite me as a vessel for storytelling, connection, self-expression and discussing the human condition.
