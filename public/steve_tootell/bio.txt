BIO:
Steve has been a pottery maker and teacher for over 45 years. Thirty five of these have been making, teaching and studying pottery in Japan from 1984-2019 whilst working as Head of Creative and Performing Arts at International School of the Sacred Heart, Tokyo. Steve has now returned to Apple Tree Studios in North Wales to concentrate on producing new work and developing his teaching studio at Apple Tree Studios, Denbigh. Steve's primary influences have been British, Indian, Australian, Japanese, Korean, American and Brazilian. Each has given a particular direction and influence to his work. Steve Tootell's work is currently exhibited in galleries in Washington, Tokyo, UK and San Paulo. He has three strands of work coming out of the Denbigh workshop: wood fired earthenware from his large wood kiln (built at Brookhouse Pottery); Raku with Japanese glazes from the gas kiln at Apple Tree Studios and Stoneware and Low Fired Slipware with photo silk screen decoration from the electric kiln at Apple Tree studios Denbigh.
