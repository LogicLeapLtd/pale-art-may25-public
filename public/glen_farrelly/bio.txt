BIO:
Glen trained at the renowned Camberwell College of Arts in London, studying for a BA (Hons) fine arts degree in ceramics. He then went on to teach Art at one of the top independent schools in London where he was Head of Art. After 20 years of teaching he moved to California. Here he was exposed to devastating wildfires that almost destroyed his home. Later, when the fires had been declared safe, he returned to his home and walked the fire ravaged sites collecting remnants of scorched and discarded wood. Changing artistic direction and materials Glen began carving and sculpting the burnt wood uncovering their beauty, showing their story, and reassembling to find their future worth. Glen's work has been displayed in exhibitions throughout California, Kuwait, Japan and he is currently showing his work across the UK at various sculpture parks and galleries. Now living in North Wales, he has been accepted as an associate member of the RCA in Conwy. Glen continues to work with reclaimed and storm fallen timber using an ancient Japanese technique called 'Yakisugi'. This method preserves the wood â€“ Yaki means to heat with fire, and sugi is cypress. By slightly charring the surface of the wood without combusting the whole piece, the wood becomes water resistant through the carbonisation and is thus more durable. It also protects against insects, as well as making the wood fire retardant. All Glen's work is sustainable and he only uses natural materials.
