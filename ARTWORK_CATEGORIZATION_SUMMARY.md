# Artwork Categorization Summary

## Overview

I've created several scripts using Playwright to analyze and categorize the artworks in your collection. Here's what was accomplished:

### 1. Scripts Created

- **`scripts/categorize-artworks.ts`** - Basic categorization based on filename patterns
- **`scripts/categorize-artworks-visual.ts`** - Enhanced version with visual analysis capabilities  
- **`scripts/categorize-from-database.ts`** - Database-based categorization using product data

### 2. Analysis Results

#### From File Analysis (522 images found):
- **Unknown**: 492 items (94.3%) - No medium keywords in filenames
- **Painting**: 18 items (3.4%)
- **Print**: 6 items (1.1%)
- **Drawing**: 4 items (0.8%)
- **Sculpture**: 2 items (0.4%)

#### From Database Analysis (202 artworks):
- **Other/Unspecified**: 196 items (97.0%)
- **Painting**: 6 items (3.0%)

### 3. Key Findings

1. **Limited Medium Data**: The database's `medium` field mostly contains file types (JPEG, PNG) rather than actual artwork mediums
2. **Missing Metadata**: Most artworks lack proper categorization data
3. **Artist Distribution**: 
   - Unknown Artist: 86 works
   - David Kereszteny Lewis: 37 works
   - Unknown Welsh Artist: 12 works
   - Steve Tootell: 11 works
   - And 16 other artists

### 4. Generated Reports

The following files have been created with the analysis results:

- `artwork-categorization-report.md` - Summary from file analysis
- `artwork-categorization.csv` - Spreadsheet format of file analysis
- `artwork-categorization-results.json` - Detailed JSON data
- `artwork-categorization-database-report.md` - Database analysis summary
- `artwork-categorization-database.csv` - Database results in CSV format

### 5. Recommendations for Better Categorization

To properly categorize artworks, you would need to:

1. **Update Database**: Add proper medium information to the Product records
2. **Visual Analysis**: Use AI vision services (like OpenAI Vision, Google Vision API, or Amazon Rekognition) to analyze images
3. **Manual Review**: Have art experts review and categorize pieces
4. **Standardize Data**: Create a controlled vocabulary for mediums (e.g., Oil on Canvas, Acrylic on Board, Bronze Sculpture, etc.)

### 6. Next Steps

If you want to proceed with visual analysis using AI:

1. Choose an AI vision service (OpenAI Vision API recommended)
2. Update the Playwright script to integrate with the chosen service
3. Run visual analysis on all images
4. Update the database with the results

The Playwright infrastructure is now in place and ready to be enhanced with AI vision capabilities when you're ready to proceed.
